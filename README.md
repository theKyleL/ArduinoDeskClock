# Project: ArduinoDeskClock
# Author: Kyle Latino

This clock program was developed for the Arduino Uno microcontroller but has also been run on the Arduino Micro with no modifications.

Each digit is illuminated one at a time. Thanks to the rapid switching nature of LEDs and our persistence of vision we see the display as being always lit.

Parts used include:
	Arduino Uno
	4-digit seven-segment display w/ colon
	74LS04 hex inverter (to avoiding grounding directly to the Arduino)
	2x normally open momentary contacts switches
	resistors (to desired brightness)
	breadboard & wires
